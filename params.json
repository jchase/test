The goal of the Tech Lab is to simplify and reduce the costs associated with the digital advertising and marketing supply chain — and for individual companies’ businesses.\r\n\r\nThe IAB Tech Lab spearheads the development of technical standards, creates a code library to assist in rapid, cost-effective implementation of IAB standards, and establishes a test platform for companies to evaluate the compatibility of their technology solutions with IAB standards, which for 18 years have been the foundation for interoperability and profitable growth in the digital advertising supply chain.\r\n\r\n#Other objectives include:\r\n\r\nSaving time and money for member companies by providing industry certification for technology vendors\r\nStreamlining processes through the reduction of compatibility issues\r\nDriving industry standards in video, mobile, “The Internet of Things,” and other emerging areas\r\n \r\n\r\n#IAB Tech Lab Membership & Governance:\r\n\r\nThe IAB Tech Lab is governed by an independent Board of Directors and Executive Committee, which oversees its agenda and funds allocation. Management of the Tech Lab reports to the senior leadership of IAB, to ensure alignment of the two associations. The Tech Lab’s governance structure will allow it to become a truly global body and accept member companies from outside the U.S. In addition, marketers and agencies, as well as other companies with interests in the digital advertising and marketing supply chain, will be invited to join. Companies that are already IAB General Members are automatically members of the IAB Tech Lab, at no cost beyond their IAB dues.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about upcoming opportunities to participate in the IAB Tech Lab, please email techlab@iab.net.\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://www.iab.net/techlab","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
